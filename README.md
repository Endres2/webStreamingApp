A web application that uses flask to create a stream of the user web cam, as well as including a static video while implementing Google's OAuth for credentials.
The website is <a href="https://stream-app-fiu.herokuapp.com/">here</a>.

I used for this project the following:
<ul>
	<li>Python</li>
	<li>Ananconda</li>
	<li>Flask Framework</li>
	<li>OAuth: Google</li>
	<li>OpenCV</li>
	<li>Ngrok</li>
	<li>Heroku</li>
</ul>

# This project was in part made possible by https://github.com/Markojudas , check out his approach for a full guide on how to build the project.

Main differences are the use of a single python app, and stylings.
